### Exercise 7.41

Rewrite your own version of the `Sales_data` class to use delegating
constructors. Add a statement to the body of each of the constructors that
prints a message whenever it is executed. Write declarations to construct a
`Sales_data` object in every way possible. Study the output until you are
certain you understand the order of execution among delgating constructors.

### Solution

See program files.
