### Exercise 15.29

Repeat your program, but this time store `shared_ptr`s to objets of type
`Quote`. Explain any discrepancy in the sum generated by this version and the
previous program. If there is no discrepancy, explain why there isn't one.

### Solution

See program files.

This program prints the result of the sum as $388.17, the previous program
prints a sum of $497.60. This discrepancy occurs because the previous program
truncated the `Bulk_quote` items in the `vector` to regular `Quote`s and removed
the bulk discount. This program correctly interprets the smart pointers as
`Bulk_quote`s and takes the right discount off.
