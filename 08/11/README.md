### Exercise 8.11

The program in this section defined its `istringstream` object inside the outer
`while` loop. What changes would you need to make if `record` were defined
outside that loop? Rewrite the program, moving the definition of `record`
outside the `while`, and see whether you thought of all the changes that are
needed.

### Solution

See `11.cc`.
