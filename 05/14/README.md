### Exercise 5.14

Write a program to read `string`s from standard input looking for duplicated
words. The program should find places in the input where one word is followed
immediately by itself. Keep track of the largest number of times a single
repetition occurs and which word is repeated. Print the maximum number of
duplicates, or else print a message saying that no word was repeated. For
example, if the input is 

```
how now now now brown cow cow
```

the output should indicate that the word `now` occurred three times.

### Solution

See `14.cc`.
