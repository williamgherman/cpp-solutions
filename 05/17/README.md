### Exercise 5.17

Given two `vector`s of `int`s, write a program to determine whether one `vector`
is a prefix of the other. For `vector`s of unequal length, compare the number of
elements of the smaller `vector`. For example, given the `vector`s containing
`{0, 1, 1, 2}` and `{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}`, respectively your program should
return `true`.

### Solution

See `17.cc`.
