### Exercise 5.20

Write a program to read a sequence of `string`s from the standard input until
either the same word occurs twice in succession or all the words have been read.
Use a while loop to read the text one word at a time. Use the `break` statement
to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice in succession. Print the word if it
occurs twice in succession, or else print a message saying that no word was
repeated.

### Solution

See `20.cc`.
