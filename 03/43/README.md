### Exercise 3.43

Write three different versions of a program to print the elements of `ia`. One
version should use a range `for` to manage the iteration; the other two should
use an ordinary `for` loop in one case using subscripts and in the other using
pointers. In all three programs write all the types directly. That is, do not
use a type alias, `auto` or `decltype` to simplify the code.

### Solution

See `43.cc`, `43b.cc` and `43c.cc`.
